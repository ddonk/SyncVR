# SyncVR

## How to run:
Download the repo and run the SyncVROpdracht.exe in the build folder.

## About the game:
The game is a reaction game, where you are a fox running through an infinite foggy forest. You are trying to dodge the twigs on the ground so you wouldn't fall over the twigs. Each time you successfully dodge a twig your score goes up. THe speed of the fox slowly increases overtime to make the game harder. If you hit a twig it is game over and you can start over again.

## Design Choices:

The assignment was to make a minigame that distracts people during painful procedures. I wanted to make a game where you would need to react to your environment and where there is a constant user input needed. Because if the user needs to be focused on the game constantly, he is distracted from the procedure with no downtime. I also made the game level infinite because if the level wouldn't have been infinite. The game could have stopped mid procedure and the user wouldn't be distracted anymore. The only downtime in my game is when you are game over. The game goes back to the main menu, this is because this was a requirement of the assignment. I personally would have just restarted the game to help the continuous user input.
